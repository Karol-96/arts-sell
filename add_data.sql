('Lindisfarne Castle, Holy Island, Northumberland', 1, 450.00, 'drawing', 'watercolor and bodycolor', 38.10, 52.00, 'UK', 2021, 'Holy Island is dramatically situated on the coast of Northumbria and is reached at low tide by a track over the sand. This watercolor was likely based on sketches Girtin made during his tour to Scotland and northern England in the summer and early fall of 1796, and probably dates from 1797, when he exhibited ten subjects from the tour at the Royal Academy. Much influenced by J. M. W. Turner (1775-1851) and by John Robert Cozens (1752-1797), Girtin imparted a visionary grandeur to the scene. The massive basalt rock, rising above the shore and topped by a sixteenth-century castle, becomes the focus of the composition, overshadowing tiny human figures in the foreground. Relegated to the distant left background are the harbor, fishing village, and church of Saint Mary, with its extensive ruins of a priory and monastery.', 'available', '$', 'large', '/img/1.jpg', '2025-10-02 06:02:00'),
('Loggia of the Ducal Palace, Venice', 1, 180.00, 'drawing', 'watercolor over graphite', 46.00, 29.00, 'UK', 2023, 'Ruskin painstakingly depicted the shafts, capitals, and ogival lacework of Venice''s most famous Gothic loggia. The red tinge to the first two shafts comes from the use of a different colored marble to mark the place from which sentences of death were proclaimed. Through the loggia, Saint Mark''s Basilica is visible. Ruskin, one of the most influential voices in the nineteenth-century art world, had a lasting love for Venice; among his most influential writings was a lengthy study of its history and architecture, The Stones of Venice (1851-53). His impassioned advocacy of the Venetian Gothic was a significant source for Gothic Revival architecture.', 'available', '$', 'small', '/img/2.jpg', '2025-08-12 06:02:00'),

He also explored new subjects, including the mythological horses of the sun. They are driven by Apollo, god of light and poetry, or by Phaethon, the boy who foolishly tried to steer the horses and fell to his death. Redon made over thirty depictions of the motif in oil, pastel, and pencil. In this version, he omitted any indication of a ground plane, so that the horses and charioteer appear to race across a boundless sky.', 'available', '$', 'medium', '/img/3.jpg', '2023-10-12 06:02:00'),

This "souvenir from Menton," as inscribed on the reverse, offers only a glimpse of the blue Mediterranean, focusing instead on the play of light across the group of trees. A practitioner of watercolor since the mid-century, the artist used nuanced tonal values to convey a range of effects from the warm light hitting the topmost branches down to the shadowy undergrowth below.', 'available', '$', 'medium', '/img/4.jpg', '2024-10-12 06:02:00'),

It is expertly composed-balanced but not predictably symmetrical-with a subtle blend of reticulated form in the foreground grass that takes full advantage of photography''s tonal capabilities. His training as a draftsman no doubt aided his aesthetic choices and taught him to identify outdoor scenes intriguing to the eye. Among those who recognized his talent was Alfred Stieglitz, who reproduced this work, along with others by members of Das Kleeblatt, in the thirteenth issue of Camera Work in 1906.', 'available', '$', 'medium', '/img/5.jpg', '2023-11-12 06:02:00'),

Throughout his twelve-month confinement, he continued to paint. In addition to the picturesque wheat fields, olive groves, cypresses, roses, and irises in and around the monastery, he captured this interior view of one of the asylum’s corridors. Despite his colorful palette, the sharply receding corridor feels hollow and haunted. Van Gogh sent the drawing to his brother Theo to give him an impression of his new surroundings.

This view was commissioned by Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro of Novar in 1843, and was later owned by John Ruskin. Its accomplished rendering of light and atmospheric effects is characteristic of Turner''s finest work. The drawing exhibits the technical prowess that made Turner both controversial and celebrated. The lake and mountains display successive applications of color—in dilute washes, drier watercolors, and semi-opaque mixtures—while the mist and reflections reveal the smooth white surface of the paper scraped out of an already painted area. The sun rises between the mountains Rossberg and Mythen behind the town of Arth while, in the foreground, nude girls play in the lake as villagers approach the shore and set out in boats.', 'available', '$', 'large', '/img/9.jpg', '2025-10-12 06:02:00'),

He moved there in autumn 1908. The estate, with its picturesque farmhouse, its groves of olive and orange trees, and the views it afforded of the hilly countryside, provided the artist with major motifs for his late landscapes. This painting, executed in a fluid manner and suffused by the bright light of southern France, is one of several representations of the farm framed by olive trees painted between 1908 and 1914. Renoir''s use of trees as a visual screen recalls Cézanne''s method of integrating foreground and background space.', 'available', '$', 'small', '/img/10.jpg', '2023-10-19 06:02:00'),

The instantaneous, snapshotlike view and the fact that the man and his mount appear to be on the verge of plunging into the viewer’s space amplify the drama. To capture naturalistic effects, Schreyvogel often painted outdoors, studying his models in daylight against the Palisades, the rugged cliffs along the Hudson River near his Hoboken, New Jersey, studio.

This drawing dates from his second sojourn in 1863-1865 and demonstrates his mastery of the medium. By reserving white areas of the paper, Harpignies brilliantly conveys the bleaching effect of the bright Italian sunshine across the shadowy gray and brown tones of the ruins. The artist made two other versions of this composition—one almost twice as large as this sheet—so it was likely for the purpose of repeating and enlarging that he lightly squared this drawing in graphite.', 'available', '$', 'medium', '/img/12.jpg', '2024-08-12 06:02:00'),

The picture presents a vision of Paradise reminiscent of that described by the great Florentine poet Dante in "The Divine Comedy." The universe is shown as a celestial globe, with the earth at the center surrounded by a series of concentric circles representing first the four elements, the known planets (including the sun, in accordance with medieval and Renaissance cosmology), and finally the constellations of the zodiac. Presiding over the scene of Creation is God the Father, bathed in a glowing celestial light as he is borne aloft by seraphim. Beside the "mappamondo" (map of the world) is the garden of Paradise, its four rivers issuing from the ground at the lower right. The garden''s effulgent flora symbolize the pure and sinless state of man before the Fall. A diminutive Adam and Eve are expelled from the garden by a lithe angel whose unusual nakedness and human form may symbolize his deep compassion for the corrupted state of humankind after the fall from grace.', 'available', '$', 'large', '/img/16.jpg', '2025-10-12 06:02:00'),

Cross executed this landscape with a palette of contrasting hues, employing a technique that he adapted from Georges Seurat earlier in his career. Strokes of paint are layered across the canvas in varying density, while also leaving areas of primed ground exposed in the foreground and at the left side of the composition. The effect of Cross''s playful variation in brushwork is decorative as it draws attention to the flat, patterned designs of color strokes.', 'available', '$', 'medium', '/img/17.jpg', '2025-10-12 06:02:00'),

During a visit to Venice in 1903 Cross achieved greater degree of fluidity and confidence with the watercolor medium. This drawing appears to record his impressions upon seeing a glittering, jewel-like Venice on the night of the annual Festival of the Redeemer, complete with fireworks and artificial lights along the water. The figure, likely a young woman, sits prominently in the foreground yet dissolves into the sinuous lines of the indistinct watery setting.
